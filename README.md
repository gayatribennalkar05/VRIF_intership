* HTML Introduction --> HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and                              images, which tell the browser how to display content. An HTML document includes tags such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` to organize and show content properly.
  
* HTML Editors--> You can create HTML pages using a simple text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac). Write your HTML code, save the file as index.html (with UTF-8 encoding), and open it in a browser                      to view the webpage. Using a basic editor helps you understand HTML structure clearly while learning.
  
* HTML Basics--> HTML documents start with <!DOCTYPE html>, followed by <html> and <body> tags where visible content is placed. Headings use <h1> to <h6>, paragraphs use <p>, links use <a href="">, and images use                   <img> with attributes like src and alt.

* HTML Elements--> An HTML element is made up of a start tag, content, and an end tag, like <p>Text</p>.Elements can be nested inside other elements, and some elements like <br> are empty (no closing tag).
                   HTML is not case sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercase and always include end tags.
  
* HTML Attributes--> HTML attributes give extra information about elements and are written inside the start tag.They are written in name="value" format like href, src, alt, style, and title.It is best to                      use lowercase letters and always put values inside quotes.

* HTML Headings--> HTML headings are used to create titles and subtitles on a webpage using <h1> to <h6> tags.<h1> is the largest and most important heading, while <h6> is the smallest and least important.
                   Headings help organize content and improve search engine understanding of the page.

* HTML Paragraph--> HTML paragraphs are created using the <p> tag and always start on a new line.Browsers ignore extra spaces and lines in the code. Use <br> for line breaks and <pre> to keep spaces and                              format.

* HTML Style--> The style attribute is used to add CSS styles like color, size, and font to HTML elements.It is written as style="property:value;" inside the tag.Common properties include background-color,                       color,font-size, font-family, and text-align.

* HTML Formatting--> HTML text formatting elements are used to display text with special meaning like bold, italic, important, or highlighted.Common tags include <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <mark>, <small>, <del>,                      <ins>, <sub>, and <sup>.These tags help style text and also give meaning to the content.

* HTML Quotation--> HTML quotation and citation elements are used to show quotes and references.<blockquote> is for long quotes, <q> is for short quotes, and <abbr> shows abbreviations with a full form on hover.
                    <address> shows contact information, <cite> shows the title of a work, and <bdo> changes text direction.

* HTML Comments--> HTML comments are written using <!-- comment --> and are not shown in the browser.They are used to add notes, reminders, or explanations in the code.Comments can also hide parts of HTML                           temporarily for testing or debugging.

* HTML Color--> HTML colors can be set using color names (like Tomato, Blue) or values such as RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, and HSLA. You can apply colors to text, background, and borders using the style attribute.
                RGBA and HSLA also allow transparency using an alpha value.

*HTML CSS--> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to design and style web pages by controlling colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, layout, borders, margins, and backgrounds. It can be added to HTML in three ways:                  inline, internal , and external. CSS helps make websites attractive and allows you to control the look of multiple pages easily.

* HTML Links--> HTML links are created using the <a> tag and the href attribute, which tells the browser where to go when the link is clicked. Links help users move from one webpage to another and can be                         text, images, or buttons. You can also use the target attribute to open the link in a new tab and mailto: to create an email link.

* HTML Images--> HTML images are added using the `<img>` tag, which is an empty tag and does not have a closing tag. It requires the `src` attribute to specify the image path and the `alt` attribute to describe                   the image if it cannot be displayed. You can also set the image size using `width` and `height` or the `style` attribute, and images can be used as links or floated using CSS.

* HTML Favicon--> A favicon is a small icon shown in the browser tab next to the page title. Add it by placing <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico"> inside the <head> section.

* HTML Tables--> HTML tables are used to organize data into rows and columns using the <table> tag. Rows are created with <tr>, table data cells with <td>, and header cells with <th>. Tables are useful                            for displaying structured data like names, numbers, or information in a clear format.

* HTML Lists--> HTML lists are used to organize related items on a webpage. An unordered list uses <ul> with <li> items and displays bullet points, while an ordered list uses <ol> with <li> items and                     displays numbers. HTML also provides description lists using <dl>, where <dt> defines the term and `<dd>` gives its description.

* HTML Block and Inline--> HTML elements are divided into block and inline elements based on their display type. Block elements start on a new line and take full width, while inline elements stay in the same                                line and take only the required space.

* HTML Div--> The <div> element is a block-level container used to group and organize other HTML elements. It takes full width by default and is commonly used with CSS for styling and layout. Multiple <div>                  elements can be aligned side by side using CSS methods like float, inline-block, flexbox, or grid.

* HTML Classes--> The HTML class attribute is used to assign a class name to an element so it can be styled using CSS or accessed using JavaScript. Multiple elements can share the same class and will get the                       same style. You can also assign multiple classes to one element by separating class names with a space, and class names are case sensitive.

* HTML Id--> The HTML id attribute is used to give a unique name to an element, and no two elements can have the same id in one page. It is used in CSS with `#idname` to style a specific element and in                        JavaScript to access it using getElementById(). Unlike class, an id is used for only one element and must be unique and case sensitive.

* HTML Button--> HTML buttons are created using the <button> tag and are used to perform actions when clicked. They can submit forms, reset forms, or run JavaScript using the `onclick` attribute. Buttons can                    also be styled with CSS and disabled using the disabled attribute.

* HTML IFrames--> An HTML iframe  is used to display another webpage inside the current webpage. It uses the src attribute to specify the page URL and should include a title for accessibility. You can set                      its size using width and height, remove the border with CSS, and even use it as a target for links.

* HTML Javascript--> HTML uses the script tag to add JavaScript, which makes web pages dynamic and interactive.JavaScript can change content, styles, and attributes using methods like document.getElementById().                       The <noscript> tag shows alternate content if JavaScript is disabled in the browser.

* HTML FilesPaths--> An HTML file path shows the location of a file in a website’s folder structure. It is used to link images, web pages, CSS files, and JavaScript files. File paths can be absolute(full URL) or                      relative(location based on the current folder).

* HTML Head--> The HTML <head> element contains information about the webpage that is not shown on the screen. It includes tags like <title>, <meta>, <link>, <style>, and <script>. It helps browsers and search                  engines understand the page.

* HTML Layout--> HTML layout elements are used to structure different parts of a webpage, such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. These semantic elements help organize content                        clearly and improve readability.

* HTML Computercode--> HTML computer code elements are used to display programming-related text clearly.

* HTML Semantics--> Semantic elements help organize content properly, improve readability, and make websites more accessible and SEO-friendly.

* HTML Entities--> HTML entities are used to display reserved or special characters in HTML. Characters like <, >, and & must be written as entities such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; so the browser does not confuse                     them with HTML tags.
* HTML Symbols--> HTML symbols are added using entity names or entity numbers when they are not available on the keyboard.

* HTML Emojis--> Emojis in HTML are Unicode (UTF-8) characters, not images, and can be added directly or using entity numbers like &#128516;.
  
* HTML Charsets--> HTML encoding (character set) tells the browser how to display characters correctly on a webpage. It is specified using <meta charset="UTF-8"> inside the <head> section.

* HTML Form--> HTML forms are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. The <form> element contains input fields like <input type="text">, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.                 Each input should have a name attribute so its value can be sent when the form is submitted.

* HTML Form Attribute--> HTML form attributes control how form data is sent and processed. The action attribute specifies where the data is sent, method defines how it is sent (GET or POST), and target decides                            where the result is displayed.

* HTML Form Elements--> HTML form elements are used to collect different types of user input. Common elements include <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>, and <button>.

* HTML Input Types--> HTML input types define different kinds of input fields inside a form using the <input> tag with the type attribute. Common types include text, password, email, radio, checkbox, submit,                           reset, date, color, and number.

* HTML Input Attribute--> HTML input attributes control how input fields behave. Common attributes include value, readonly, disabled, required, and placeholder.

* HTML Canvas--> The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a webpage using JavaScript. It acts as a container, and you must use JavaScript methods to draw shapes, lines, text, images, or gradients.                    Always include id, width, and height attributes when creating a canvas.

* HTML SVG--> SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is used to create vector-based graphics for the web using XML. SVG images can be resized or zoomed without losing quality and are supported by all major browsers.
              The <svg> element is used to draw shapes like circles, rectangles, polygons, text, and gradients directly inside HTML.

* HTML Media--> HTML multimedia includes sound, music, videos, animations, and other media elements used on web pages. Media files have different formats like MP4, WebM, MP3, WAV, and Ogg

* HTML Videos--> The HTML <video> element is used to display videos on a webpage. It supports formats like MP4, WebM, and Ogg, and you can add the controls attribute to show play, pause, and volume buttons.

* HTML Audio--> The HTML <audio> element is used to play sound files on a webpage. You can add the controls attribute to show play, pause, and volume options, and use multiple <source> tags for different formats like MP3, WAV, and Ogg.

* HTML Youtube--> HTML YouTube videos can be added easily using the <iframe> tag. Instead of converting video formats, you can upload your video to YouTube and use its video ID to embed it on your webpage
